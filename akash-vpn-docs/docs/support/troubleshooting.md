### Manual Configuration Testing

**Test server connectivity**:

```bash
# Test if server is reachable (replace with actual server address)
ping server-hostname.com
telnet server-hostname.com 1194
```

**DNS Resolution Test**:

```bash
# Test if you can resolve server hostname
nslookup server-hostname.com
```
