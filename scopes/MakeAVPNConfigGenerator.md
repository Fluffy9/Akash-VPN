# Make a VPN Config Generator [Advanced]
please research and implement SoftEther VPN config generation with automation possibilities

## What Specifically Needs to Be Done (Deliverables)
### [1st Deliverable]
Research and implement SoftEther VPN configuration generation with automation possibilities. If not completed in 1 hour, document what remains to be done.
### [Additional Info]
SoftEther VPN needs to be configured to generate .ovpn files for users. Research how this can be done programmatically and what automation options exist.

**Approach:**
Research the key vpncmd commands needed (UserCreate and OpenVpnMakeConfig) and create a script that connects to the SoftEther VPN server, navigates to the Virtual Hub, creates users, and generates .ovpn files. The vpncmd tool is well-documented and this approach is achievable.

**What to include:**
- Research SoftEther VPN command-line tools and APIs
- Investigate vpncmd.exe and its automation capabilities
- Look into SoftEther VPN Manager API
- Research existing automation scripts and tools
- Create basic scripts to generate .ovpn files using vpncmd.exe
- Research if config generation can be triggered via API calls
- If not completed: Document remaining tasks and next steps

### [1st Deliverable]: 1 hours
Summary: research and implement SoftEther VPN config generation with automation possibilities.
Total Estimated Time: 1 hours
