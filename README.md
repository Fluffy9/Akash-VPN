A comprehensive, decentralized VPN solution built on the Akash Network. Akash VPN provides secure, private internet access without centralized control, leveraging the power of decentralized cloud infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To get started with Akash VPN, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the SoftEther VPN SDL to Akash using the deployment file located at `vpn/deploy.yml`.
2. Once deployed, obtain the lease URL and update the `akashic-records.json` file in `frontend/public/data` with the new hostname.
3. Deploy the frontend SDL using the deployment file located at `frontend/deploy.yml`.
4. Visit the frontend URL and download the OpenVPN configuration file by clicking the "Download Region 1 Config" button.
5. Import the configuration file into your OpenVPN client and connect to the VPN.
