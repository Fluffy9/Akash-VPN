# 📘 FAQ

### ❓ What’s a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) helps you stay private and secure online. It hides your real IP address and encrypts your internet connection — making it harder for websites, advertisers, or even your internet provider to track you. Think of it like a secure tunnel for your data.

### 🌍 What is Akash?

Akash is a decentralized cloud network — kind of like Airbnb, but for servers. Instead of relying on big tech companies like Amazon or Google, we run our VPN on independent servers powered by the [Akash Network](https://akash.network). That means more privacy, better control, and often lower cost.

---

### 🔐 Why should I use a VPN?

Here’s why people use VPNs every day:

* **Privacy**: Stop your ISP, apps, or trackers from spying on your activity.
* **Security**: Use public Wi-Fi safely (airports, cafes, etc.).
* **Freedom**: Access content that might be blocked or restricted in your country.
* **Peace of Mind**: You don’t need to worry who’s watching.

---

### 🌐 What countries do you have servers in?

We currently have active servers in:

* **Belgium** 🇧🇪 (Belgium Server)
* **United States** 🇺🇸 (Texas Server)
* **Switzerland** 🇨🇭 (Switzerland Server)

These are real, audited providers on the Akash Network — and we're expanding all the time! Each server is independently deployed and managed, ensuring maximum privacy and reliability.

### 🧠 Do I need to understand Akash or crypto to use this?

Not at all. The tech runs in the background. You just use the app, click “Connect,” and go. It works like any other VPN — just smarter, more private, and backed by decentralized infrastructure.

---

### 🔍 Does Akash VPN keep logs of my online activity?

No. We have a strict **no-logs policy**. We do not track or store your browsing history, IP address, or connection timestamps.

---

### 🔎 Will this make me completely anonymous?

A VPN gives you **strong privacy**, but not total invisibility. We don’t keep logs, and your connection is encrypted.

---

### 🔄 Can I switch servers while connected?

Yes! You can disconnect from one server and connect to another at any time through the app to optimize speed or access different locations.

---

### 🧩 Can I use Akash VPN with other VPNs or proxies?

Generally, it’s not recommended to chain VPNs or proxies as it can cause connectivity issues and slowdowns. Use Akash VPN as your primary privacy tool.

---

### 🤔 What makes Akash VPN different from other VPN services?

Akash VPN runs on a **decentralized network**, meaning it doesn’t rely on any single company’s servers. This reduces risk of censorship, downtime, or data misuse, and increases privacy and control for you.

---

### 🔐 Do I need client certificates to connect?

No! Akash VPN uses **username/password authentication** for simplicity and ease of use. The OpenVPN configuration files include server certificates for server verification, but you don't need to manage any client certificates. Just enter your username and password when prompted by your OpenVPN client.
